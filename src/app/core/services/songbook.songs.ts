    lyrics: `O Holy Night!
      The stars are brightly shining
      It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
      Long lay the world in sin and error pining
      Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
      A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
      For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

      Fall on your knees
      Oh hear the angel voices
      Oh night divine
      Oh night when Christ was born
      Oh night divine
      Oh night divine

      Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
      With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
      So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
      Here come the wise men from Orient land
      The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
      In all our trials born to be our friend

      Truly He taught us to love one another
      His law is love and His gospel is peace
      Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
      And in His name all oppression shall cease
      Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
      Let all within us praise His holy name`

    Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
    Born this happy morning;
    Jesus, to Thee be the glory giv'n;
    Word of the Father,
    Now in the flesh appearing,

    O come, let us adore Him,

    lyrics: `Dashing through the snow
    On a one horse open sleigh
    O'er the fields we go,
    Laughing all the way
    Bells on bob tail ring,
    making spirits bright
    What fun it is to laugh and sing
    A sleighing song tonight

    Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh

    A day or two ago,
    I thought I'd take a ride,
    And soon Miss Fanny Bright
    Was seated by my side;
    The horse was lean and lank
    Misfortune seemed his lot
    We got into a drifted bank,
    And then we got upsot.

    Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh

    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.
    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.

    Now the ground is white
    Go it while you're young
    Take the girls tonight
    And sing this sleighing song
    Just get a bob tailed bay
    two-forty as his speed
    Hitch him to an open sleigh
    And crack! you'll take the lead

    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.
    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.`
