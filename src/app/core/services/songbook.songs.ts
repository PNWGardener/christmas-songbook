    lyrics: `O Holy Night!
      The stars are brightly shining
      It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
      Long lay the world in sin and error pining
      Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
      A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
      For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

      Fall on your knees
      Oh hear the angel voices
      Oh night divine
      Oh night when Christ was born
      Oh night divine
      Oh night divine

      Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
      With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
      So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
      Here come the wise men from Orient land
      The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
      In all our trials born to be our friend

      Truly He taught us to love one another
      His law is love and His gospel is peace
      Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
      And in His name all oppression shall cease
      Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
      Let all within us praise His holy name`

    On a one horse open sleigh
    O'er the fields we go,
    Laughing all the way
    Bells on bob tail ring,
    making spirits bright
    What fun it is to laugh and sing
    A sleighing song tonight

    Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh

    A day or two ago,
    I thought I'd take a ride,
    And soon Miss Fanny Bright
    Was seated by my side;
    The horse was lean and lank
    Misfortune seemed his lot
    We got into a drifted bank,
    And then we got upsot.

    Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh

    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.
    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.

    Now the ground is white
    Go it while you're young
    Take the girls tonight
    And sing this sleighing song
    Just get a bob tailed bay
    two-forty as his speed
    Hitch him to an open sleigh
    And crack! you'll take the lead

    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.
    Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh, What fun it is to ride
    In a one horse open sleigh.`

    I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
    And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh.

    Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay

    Was to certain poor shepherds
    in fields as they lay;
    In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,
    On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.

    They looked up and saw a star
    Shining in the east beyond them far,
    And to the earth it gave great light,
    And so it continued both day and night.

    And by the light of that same star
    Three wise men came from country far;
    To seek for a king was their intent,
    And to follow the star wherever it went.

    This star drew nigh to the northwest,
    O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right over the place where Jesus lay.


    Then entered in those wise men three
    Full reverently upon their knee,
    and offered there in his presence
    Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.

    Then let us all with one accord
    Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
    That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
    And with his blood mankind hath bought

    With a corn cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal.

    Frosty the Snowman, is a fairytale, they say.
    He was made of snow, but the children know he came to life one day.

    There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,

    For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around!

    Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;
    and the children say he could laugh and play,
    just the same as you and me.

    Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
    look at Frosty go.

    Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
    over the hills of snow.

    Frosty the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,
    so he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun now, before I melt away."

    Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
    Running here and there, all around the square,
    sayin', "Catch me if you can."

    He led them down the streets of town, right to the traffic cop;

    and only paused a moment, when he heard him holler, "Stop!"

    For Frosty, the Snowman, had to hurry on his way,
    But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't cry, I'll be back again some day.`

    That glorious song of old,
    From angels bending near the earth
    To touch their harps of gold!

    Peace on the earth, good will to men,
    From heaven's all gracious King!
    The world in solemn stillness lay
    To hear the angels sing.


    Still through the cloven skies they come
    With peaceful wings unfurled
    And still their heavenly music floats
    O'er all the weary world;
    Above its sad and lowly plains
    They bend on hovering wing.
    And ever o'er its Babel sounds
    The blessed angels sing.

    Yet with te woes of sin and strife
    The world hath suffered long;
    Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
    Two thousand years of wrong;
    And man, at war with man, hears not
    The love song which they bring:
    O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
    And hear the angels sing.

    For lo! the days are hastening on,
    By prophet bards foretold,
    When, with the ever-circling years,
    Shall come the Age of Gold;
    When peace shall over all the earth
    Its ancient splendors fling,
    And all the world give back the song
    Which now the angels sing.

    on the feast of Stephen,
    when the snow lay round about,

    when a poor man came in sight,
    gathering winter fuel.

    Hither, page, and stand by me.
    If thou know it telling:
    yonder peasant, who is he?
    Where and what his dwelling?
    Sire, he lives a good league hence,
    underneath the mountain,
    right against the forest fence
    by Saint Agnes fountain.

    Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
    Bring me pine logs hither.
    Thou and I will see him dine
    when we bear the thither.
    Page and monarch, forth they went,
    forth they went together
    through the rude wind's wild lament
    and the bitter weather.

    Sire, the night is darker now,
    and the wind blows stronger.
    Fails my heart, I know not how.
    I can go no longer.
    Ark my footsteps my good page,
    tread thou in them boldly:
    Thou shalt find the winter's rage
    freeze thy blood less coldly.

    In his master's step he trod,
    where the snow lay dented.
    Heat was in the very sod
    which the saint had printed.

    ye who now will bless the poor
